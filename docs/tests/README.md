# dcrypt Tests (`tests`)

The `tests` crate is a dedicated workspace member for housing integration tests, constant-time verification tests, and potentially other complex test suites for the dcrypt library. This separation allows for more elaborate test setups and dependencies without polluting the main library crates.

## Purpose

-   **Integration Testing**: Verify that different components of the dcrypt library (e.g., `algorithms`, `symmetric`, `kem`, `sign`, `hybrid`) work together correctly.
-   **Cross-Implementation Testing**: Compare dcrypt's algorithm outputs against known test vectors or potentially other cryptographic libraries. The `cross_implementation_tests.rs` file suggests this intent.
-   **Constant-Time Verification**: Implement tests to statistically analyze the timing behavior of cryptographic primitives to ensure they are constant-time with respect to secret inputs. The `constant_time` directory and `constant_time_tests.rs` point to this. This likely uses a framework like `dudect` or a custom similar approach (as hinted in `DOCS.md`).
-   **Test Vector Management**: Centralize and manage test vectors for various algorithms, possibly loaded from JSON or other formats (indicated by `vectors` directory and files like `blake3_vectors.json`).
-   **Hybrid Scheme Testing**: Specifically test the combined functionality of hybrid KEMs and signature schemes (`hybrid_tests.rs`).
-   **KEM Specific Tests**: Detailed tests for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (`kem_tests.rs`).

## Structure

The `tests` crate has the following notable structure:

-   **`src/lib.rs`**: The main library file for the test crate. It likely pulls in modules for different test categories.
-   **`src/constant_time/`**:
    *   `config.rs`: Configuration for constant-time tests.
    *   `mod.rs`: Module declaration.
    *   `tester.rs`: Logic for running constant-time tests. This might implement or wrap a statistical framework. The "Novel Algorithm for Determining Constant-Time Behavior" mentioned in `DOCS.md` would likely be implemented or utilized here.
-   **`src/vectors/`**: Directory for storing and managing test vectors.
    *   Subdirectories for specific algorithms (e.g., `cbc`, `chacha`, `ctr`, `gcm`, `sha2`, `sha3`, `shake`).
    *   `blake3_vectors.json`: Example of test vectors in JSON format.
    *   `custom.rs`, `fips.rs`, `nist_pqc.rs`: Rust modules potentially for parsing or generating test vectors from different sources or for specific standards.
-   **`tests/` directory (within the `tests` crate itself)**: This is where the actual test functions are defined, using the `#[test]` attribute.
    *   `constant_time_tests.rs`: Contains test cases that utilize the constant-time testing framework.
    *   `cross_implementation_tests.rs`: For comparing dcrypt outputs.
    *   `hybrid_tests.rs`: For testing hybrid cryptographic schemes.
    *   `integration_tests.rs`: General integration tests.
    *   `kem_tests.rs`: Specific tests for KEMs.

## Dependencies

The `Cargo.toml` for the `tests` crate includes dependencies on all major dcrypt workspace members (`algorithms`, `api`, `common`, `hybrid`, `internal`, `kem`, `sign`, `symmetric`) to allow comprehensive testing. It also includes development dependencies like `rand_chacha` (for deterministic RNG in tests if needed) and `statrs` (a statistics library, likely used by the constant-time testing framework).

## Running Tests

Tests would typically be run using `cargo test` from the root of the `dcrypt` workspace or from within the `crates/tests` directory:

```bash
# From the workspace root
cargo test -p tests

# Or, from crates/tests
cd crates/tests
cargo test
```

## Key Test Areas

-   **Correctness**: Verifying algorithm outputs against known-answer tests (KATs) and official test vectors.
-   **Security Properties**:
-   Constant-time behavior of sensitive operations.
-   Correct handling of keys, nonces, and other cryptographic parameters.
-   Proper error handling for invalid inputs or conditions.
-   **API Usability**: Ensuring the public APIs are ergonomic and function as documented.
-   **Interoperability** (Cross-Implementation): Ensuring that dcrypt can, for example, verify signatures or decrypt ciphertexts generated by other standard implementations (if applicable test vectors are used).
-   **Hybrid Scheme Logic**: Verifying that the combination logic in hybrid schemes is correct and that they achieve the intended combined security properties (at least structurally).

This dedicated test crate is crucial for maintaining the quality, correctness, and security of the dcrypt library.
